This is a tool to categorize your expenses as recorded by your bank. First you download the data from the bank in CSV format. Import it here and choose the categories. This tool allows you to do all that without storing your data on any server - it's stored in your browser local storage and not transmitted over the network. So nobody can see your money business.

Tool is not live yet. Download your local copy from [GitHub](https://github.com/spidgorny/umsaetze/)
